# Neural-Network

Building of a Deep Learning Library

Here we'll build a deep learning library from scratch (well, from NumPy) in 45 minutes.

Along the way we'll talk about library design, type hinting, Python 3.6, and of course deep learning.

Here's the plan:
Tensors
Loss Functions
Layers
Neural Nets
Optimizers
Data
Training
XOR Example
FizzBuzz Example
